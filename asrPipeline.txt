- "According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. It's wings are too small to
   get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway, because bees don't care what humans think is impossible." -> longer sentence

Performance:
- "Hello world."
- "She sells seashells by the seashore the shells that she sells our seashells I'm sure."
- "According to all known laws of aviation there is no way you should be able to fly its wings are too small to get its
   fat little body off the ground the bee of course flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible."

The first "hello world" is pretty spot on, and the second sentence is almost perfect, except that it confused "our" with "are",
which honestly was not where I was expecting it to mess up in the sentence. The last sentence is almost perfect as well, with
a few small substitution errors. Overall, I would say it's great, although, it doesn't really pick up on any punctuation
of any kind.
